Project proposals:

Please submit proposals for projects for the class. Students may complete the project alone or pair up with one or two other students. It is generally quite helpful for each team to include students with different backgrounds. Topics for projects can include anything that is relevant to the class material. Your proposal should include a list of the people who will be working on the project, a title, and a one-page description, with enough detail that the instructor can provide feedback to help direct your work.
